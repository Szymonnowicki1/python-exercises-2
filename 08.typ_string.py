article = """Monty Python (also collectively known as the Pythons)[2][3] were a 
British surreal comedy troupe who created the sketch comedy television show 
Monty Python's Flying Circus, which first aired on the BBC in 1969. Forty-five
 episodes were made over four series. The Python phenomenon developed from the 
 television series into something larger in scope and influence, including 
 touring stage shows, films, albums, books and musicals. The Pythons' 
 influence on comedy has been compared to the Beatles' influence on music.
 [4][5][6] Regarded as an enduring icon of 1970s pop culture, their sketch
 show has been referred to as being "an important moment in the evolution
 of television comedy".[7]"""
